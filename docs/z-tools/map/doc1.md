The primary purpose of the street map is to delineate target areas for finding, downloading, and clipping elevation data.  The map provides tools to draw a polyline, buffered polyline, polygon and rectangle.  Existing XML files in the XML Folder can be imported into the map for visualization purposes.  The map provides direct links to the USGS National Map as well as Google Maps for reference purposes.  A LiDAR / DEM USGS availability report can be generated based on the current map center.  This report is generated by querying Publicly available USGS GIS web resources.
