## Overview

The main interface is a container for geoprocessing tools and project and global settings. 

The interface includes a Tool Navigation List on the left, a toolbar along the top, a project combo box, and a group of tabs providing access to various project and global settings.

Here is a list of the tabs...

  * **Info** General information about GeoSync Z-Tools
  * **Paths** Project and application path settings.  The project path is the most important. It points to the root folder where your project data will be stored. The actual path adds a \projects to the root path.
  * **Files** Tool for summarizing the projects with size (GB) included in the current Project path. 
  * **Tools** List of all tools included with GeoSync Z-Tools.  Check the tools you want to hide and NOT show in the Tool Navigation List.
  * **Map** 
  * **Read Me**
  * **Activate**
  * **User Grids**
