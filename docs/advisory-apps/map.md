The map editing interface is in the admin section of your advisory app. After logging in, access it by going to:

Pages > Map Page

The first field is a map field that sets the center of the map when it is first loaded. This will usually be a zoomed out area of the region, but could also be adjusted to be centered on a particular area of interest for an advisory. To set the center, just click on the map where you want the center to be and a blue dot will appear to indicate the point.

The next field is the inital zoom of the map. Currently there is not a display of the zoom value of the map, but in most cases the default will be around 13 which will allow a view of a city. Increasing the zoom will move the map closer for viewing city blocks. You would probably never want to increase it past 18.

The next three fields are all optional and will store information for an alert area. The first two will be the title and description of the alert that will be displayed on the tooltip when the alert area is tapped. The last one is another map field that lets you define the alert area. This field lets you draw a polygon. To start drawing the polygon, click on the map to set one point of the polygon. Move your mouse and click to set more points of the polygon. For the last point, you can double-click to autocomplete the polygon or you can click on the starting point.

When the map page is saved and built, the changes should be reflected on the advisory app. Currently, any posts linking to advisory areas should simply just link to the map. The map settings should be set to load in way that best displays the alert area. Also, at this time, only one alert area can be set at a time.
